- working with data is hard to make a process around
    - things are unexpected
    - can't predict the outcome until you try
    - plans/expectations are constantly changing
    - like a bloodhound on a trail -- you know you're on to something but you're
      not sure where it'll take you

- gets multiplied if you are trying to build a product
    - how does the product plan change as understanding of data changes?
    - 

- Big themes I've learned from making data products
    - data first
    - algo first
    - things will go wrong and turn in unexpected ways
    - new data/algos have no ethical considerations
    -

- data first: realtime

- algo first: roborealator

- research failure: 

- deploy failure:

- all goes perfectly:
