# Outline

- I grew up reading and watching scifi
    - conversations with my computer? sure!
    - tricorders? hell yea!
- Always begged the question, "What do I _want_ the world to look like?"

- blah blah blah

- Multiple ways to get to the goal (most ideas inspired from one of these
  things):
    - data inspiration (must find algorithm)
    - algorithmic inspiration (must find data)
- You learn quickly that algorithms generally only work on _certain_ data... not
  as generalized as we hope
    - examples in the form (slide1: OMG ALGO1 DOES "blah", slide2: only works
      for "blah" type of data)

- Example of data-first project
    - weather
    - realtime?

- Example of algo-first project
    - ffl!

- The hard questions:
    - What to do if development fails?
    - What to do if error rates are high?
    - How do we know when we've won?
    - How do we respect our ethical obligations to users/humans?

- Dev Failing:
    - research is hard and unpredictable
    - algorithm may have too high error or not scale
    - data may not be clean or have the correct signals
    - 

- Also, error is not failure but an inevitable part of working with data
    - don't count on your counts counting what you counted on.
    - modern NN algorithms have acceptable error rates >= 15%
    - don't fight it... embrace it (prob. data structures?)
